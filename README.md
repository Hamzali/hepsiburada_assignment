## Personal Information and Notes

- I ussualy work with NodeJS, ReactJS and React-Native as a FullStack however due to the wide range of selection of programming languages I wanted to use and demonstrate the power of a truly engineered and matured language Elixir. I esspecially love documentation and testing environment in Elixir, in the other hand it's mutation free functional world helps to write better and readable code. It was a breeze to use Elixir after using NodeJS :D

- Sadly my assignment dates were on Eid holiday, therefor I could not get any answers to my assignment questions. I expected a little more from Hepsiburada crew. It made me sad :(
